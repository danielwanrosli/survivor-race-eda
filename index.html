                  Race and Reality: Exploring Contestant Performance Before and After the CBS Diversity Promise

              <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px;">In 2020, CBS pledged that all reality casts will be represented with at least 50% people of color. These shows are a microcosm of society in that they highlight the need to strategize, form alliances, and compete in order to succeed in a competitive environment. Historically, minority contestants have been naturally subject to early elimination due to innate similar-attraction being a large reason as to why dominant alliances form. In my article, I would like to analyze whether CBS’ new policy has had its intended effect in giving people of color an equal opportunity to succeed, and consider the nuances of how gender and ethnicity may play a deeper role in a contestant’s success. </p>

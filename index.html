                  Exploring Contestant Performance in Survivor Before and After the CBS Diversity Promise

              <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px;">In 2020, CBS pledged that all reality casts will be represented with at least 50% people of color. In this article, we will be looking at the policy's impact on the show, Survivor. Survivor is a microcosm of society in that it highlights the need to strategize, form alliances, and manipulate one another in order to succeed in a competitive environment. Historically, minority contestants have been naturally subject to early elimination due to innate similar-attraction being a large reason as to why dominant alliances form. In my article, I would like to analyze whether CBS’ new policy has had its intended effect in giving people of color an equal opportunity to succeed, and consider the nuances of how gender and ethnicity may play a deeper role in a contestant’s success. </p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>Survivor is a reality TV show where contestants compete against each other for a million dollar prize. Every few days at "Tribal Council", the players must vote off one of the players from their tribe, eliminating them from the game.
                  Contestants are inclined to form alliances and manipulate each other to leverage their position in the game.
                  The game concludes with a final Tribal Council, where the remaining players must make their case to a jury comprised of their eliminated peers who decide the Sole Survivor by majority vote.</p>
              <p>The 20-year long trend of casting predominantly White casts on Survivor has had a disproportionate effect on the outcomes of the show's winners. Not only is this an inaccurate representation of the demographics of the U.S, it is indicative of a larger issue in the media––people of color are largely underrepresented in the media that America produces, and often their stories are either misrepresented or completely absent. With the show striving for diversity, we will analyze whether or not the playing field was leveled for all contestants to have a fair opportunity. </p>
              <h2>Data Exploration</h2>

              <p>Survivor has had a long history of predominantly White casts, which has led to predominantly White winners. With our first visualization, we will explore to what extent
              the reality show skews against the success of people of color.</p>

              <p>
                  As a huge Survivor fan and someone who was generally aware of the lack of diversity the show had, seeing how dominantly White the winner’s circle was in each era was still astonishing.
                  Since the diversity initiative, there have only been three complete seasons, so this sample size is not nearly equivalent to the sizes of the other samples. However, it is still notable that of the three seasons produced after the diversity initiative, we have immediately produced two POC winners.
                  Additionally, Season 42 saw a black woman winning Survivor for the first time in nearly 20 years, with the last black woman winning in Season 4.
                  It is also interesting to note that seasons 13 and 14 played around with the idea of a cast that was evenly split between the four races being compared in the article.
                  Both seasons produced a minority winner, where season 13 produced a final three where ⅔ were Asian, and season 14 produced an all-Black final three. These are additional data points that support innate-similar attraction being a large reason as to why alliances form, and why so many seasons that lack people of color are White dominated.
